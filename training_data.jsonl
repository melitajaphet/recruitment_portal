Presented QA Group on the Department meetings as a QA\r\nTeam Lead and conference calls every 4 hours, which included report of the progress in the testing cycle. Made sure that needed support was\r\nprovided to the QA Team from the Developing Team. Performed manual and automated testing of the application. Entered open/found Drs/bugs\r\ninto TRACKER bug tracking database and verified that Drs/bugs was close/fixed. Wrote and executed test cases for acceptance, boundary,\r\nperformance, regression, volume and stress testing. Developed and performed automated test cases using QA Partner 4.0 in Windows NT\r\nenvironment.
